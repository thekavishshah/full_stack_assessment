# HIPAA Compliance & Security Plan

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 with SMART on FHIR for user authentication.
   - Issue JWT access tokens and validate scopes for each API request.

2. **Data Encryption**
   - Enforce HTTPS/TLS for all data in transit.
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256.

3. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access control: limit FHIR resource access by user role (e.g., clinician vs. researcher).
   - Log all access and modification events in an immutable audit log.

4. **Audit Logging & Monitoring**
   - Record user ID, timestamp, endpoint, and resource ID for each API call.
   - Integrate with SIEM for real-time anomaly detection.

5. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Deploy backend services in a private VPC; restrict API access to white-listed IPs.
   - Use container security scanning (e.g., Clair) and regular vulnerability assessments.
